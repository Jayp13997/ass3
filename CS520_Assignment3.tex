\begin{problem}{1}
Marie is getting married tomorrow at an outdoor ceremony in NYC. In recent years,
it rained about once every three days. The weatherman has predicted there will be no rain for
tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherman correctly forecasts rain 80 percent of the time. When
it doesn’t rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 20 percent of the time. What is the probability that it will
rain on the day of Marie’s wedding according to Bayes’ rule?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution} \\
Let A = the event that it rains \\
Let B = the event that the weatherman predicts no rain \\
\begin{align}
P(A | B) &= \frac{P(B | A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{5} * \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3} * \frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{3} * \frac{4}{5}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{15}}{\frac{1}{15}+\frac{8}{15}} \\
&= \frac{\frac{1}{15}}{\frac{9}{15}} \\
&= \frac{1}{9}
\end{align}
\end{solution}
